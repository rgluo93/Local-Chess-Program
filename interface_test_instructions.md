# Interface Improvements Test Instructions

Test the following improvements at http://localhost:3000:

## ✅ 1. Universal Piece Selection (Green Highlight)
- **Test**: Click on any piece (even if it has no legal moves)
- **Expected**: Piece gets green highlight background
- **Try**: Click on a bishop or knight that's blocked by pawns - should still highlight green

## ✅ 2. Check Highlighting (Soft Orange Glow)
- **Test**: Put the king in check (e.g., move Queen to attack king)
- **Expected**: King shows soft orange glow effect with two-layer highlight
- **Note**: Orange glow should be drawn behind other highlights

## ✅ 3. Resign Button in Check
- **Test**: Put yourself in check, then try to resign
- **Expected**: Resign button should be enabled and work
- **Previous bug**: Was disabled when in check

## ✅ 4. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Test**: Click pieces and valid moves
- **Expected**: 
  - Selected pieces: Green background + border
  - Valid moves: Blue circular dots
  - Check: Soft orange glow on king

## Test Scenarios

1. **Start game** → Click any piece → Should get green highlight
2. **Make moves to put king in check** → King should glow orange
3. **While in check** → Resign button should work
4. **Click blocked pieces** → Should still highlight green (no blue dots)
5. **Valid moves** → Should show blue dots in addition to green selection

All improvements should work together seamlessly.
