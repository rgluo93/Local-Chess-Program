## Integration Architecture Overview

### Component Coordination Pattern
The ChessGameOrchestrator (Phase 1.4) serves as the central coordination hub that connects all components:

```
ChessGameOrchestrator
├── GameEngine (moves, validation)
├── GameStateManager (state coordination)
├── MoveHistoryManager (move tracking)
├── EndgameDetector (game analysis)
├── NotationGenerator (move notation)
├── GameStateSerialization (persistence)
└── UI Components (React interface)
```

### Integration Points by Phase

**Phase 1.4**: Core component integration and API layer
- All backend components communicate through unified GameAPI
- Event-driven architecture for real-time coordination
- State synchronization across all components

**Phase 2.3**: UI-Backend integration
- React components connect to ChessGameOrchestrator
- Real-time board updates from game state changes
- Move validation integrated with UI feedback

**Phase 3.2**: Special moves integration
- Advanced chess logic coordination across all components
- Notation updates for castling, en passant, promotion
- Endgame detection includes special move analysis

**Phase 4.1-4.3**: UI state integration
- Zoom and responsive settings persist through GameStateManager
- Performance optimization includes full integration pipeline
- UI events coordinate with backend state management

**Phase 5.1-5.3**: Complete state integration
- Save/load preserves all component states simultaneously
- Move history UI synchronized with backend MoveHistoryManager
- Game ending events trigger coordinated updates across all systems

**Phase 6**: Integration testing and validation
- End-to-end testing of complete coordination system
- Cross-browser integration compatibility
- Performance benchmarking of integrated system

### Key Integration Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: ChessGameOrchestrator maintains authoritative state
2. **Event-Driven Updates**: Components react to state changes via events
3. **Atomic Operations**: Move validation, history updates, and UI changes occur together
4. **Error Handling**: Integration failures are handled gracefully with rollback
5. **Performance**: Integration overhead should be minimized and optimized in later phases
