- **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps for all animations and interactions
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks during extended gameplay
- **Scalability**: Supports board scaling from 384px to 1024px without performance degradation

### Performance Monitoring

Use browser developer tools to monitor:
- **Animation frame rate** in Performance tab
- **Memory usage** for leak detection
- **Network requests** (should be zero after initial load)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Application won't start
```bash
# Solution: Check Node.js version and reinstall dependencies
node --version  # Should be v16+
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

**Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors
```bash
# Solution: Run type checker and fix errors
npm run type-check
```

**Issue**: Tests failing
```bash
# Solution: Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
```

**Issue**: Poor performance/choppy animations
- **Check browser**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
- **Close other tabs**: Reduce browser memory usage
- **Check system**: Ensure adequate RAM and CPU resources

**Issue**: LocalStorage not working
- **Check browser settings**: Ensure cookies/storage not blocked
- **Private browsing**: LocalStorage may be limited in private/incognito mode
- **Storage quota**: Check if browser storage quota exceeded

### Getting Help

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Review implementation plan** for phase-specific guidance
3. **Check system design** for architectural questions
4. **Verify requirements** for feature specifications

## Contributing

## Architecture

This application follows a layered architecture with integrated component coordination:

- **Presentation Layer**: React components and Canvas rendering
- **Integration Layer**: ChessGameOrchestrator for component coordination (Phase 1.4)
- **Application Layer**: State management and UI controllers
- **Business Logic Layer**: Chess engine and game rules with comprehensive analysis
- **Data Layer**: LocalStorage persistence and serialization

**Component Integration**: All backend components (GameEngine, GameStateManager, MoveHistoryManager, EndgameDetector, NotationGenerator, GameStateSerialization) work together through a unified API and event-driven coordination system.

For detailed architecture information, see `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Current Test Status
