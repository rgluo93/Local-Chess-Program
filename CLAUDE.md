## Three-Fold Repetition Draw Detection

### Overview
The chess program implements automatic three-fold repetition draw detection using a manual position tracking system that replaces Chess.js's built-in functionality for improved reliability.

### Key Features

#### Manual Position Tracking
- **Implementation**: Custom FEN-based position history tracking in `GameEngine.ts`
- **Accuracy**: Tracks normalized FEN positions throughout the game
- **Reliability**: Bypasses Chess.js internal three-fold repetition logic which proved unreliable
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing draw detection and game result systems

#### Position Normalization
- **FEN Components**: Only considers board position, active color, and castling rights
- **Ignored Elements**: Excludes en passant, halfmove clock, and fullmove number for accurate repetition detection
- **Format**: `"position active_color castling_rights"` (first 3 components of FEN)

#### Automatic Detection
- **Real-time Checking**: Evaluates three-fold repetition after every move
- **Game Status Integration**: Updates game status to 'draw' when detected
- **Result Handling**: Sets game result to '1/2-1/2' automatically
- **UI Integration**: Draw reason displayed as 'threefold_repetition'

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Files
```
src/engine/
├── GameEngine.ts             # Manual three-fold repetition implementation
├── GameStateManager.ts       # Game state coordination and draw handling
└── orchestrator/ChessGameOrchestrator.ts  # Move processing integration
```

#### Key Methods

##### GameEngine.ts
```typescript
// Position history tracking
private positionHistory: string[] = [];

// Manual three-fold repetition detection
private isThreefoldRepetitionManual(): boolean {
  if (this.positionHistory.length < 3) return false;
  const currentPosition = this.positionHistory[this.positionHistory.length - 1];
  const occurrences = this.countPositionOccurrences(currentPosition);
  return occurrences >= 3;
}

// FEN normalization for repetition comparison
private normalizeFENForRepetition(fen: string): string {
  const parts = fen.split(' ');
  return `${parts[0]} ${parts[1]} ${parts[2]}`; // position, turn, castling
}

// Position occurrence counting
private countPositionOccurrences(normalizedFEN: string): number {
  return this.positionHistory.filter(fen => fen === normalizedFEN).length;
}
```

#### State Management Integration
- **GameStatus**: `getGameStatus()` checks manual three-fold repetition
- **GameResult**: `getGameResult()` returns '1/2-1/2' for three-fold repetition
- **DrawReason**: `getDrawReason()` returns 'threefold_repetition' when applicable
- **Public Interface**: `isThreefoldRepetition()` uses manual implementation

#### Position History Management
- **Initialization**: Starting position added in constructor
- **Move Processing**: New position added after each valid move
- **Reset Handling**: Position history cleared and reinitialized on game reset
- **Load Position**: Position history reset when loading FEN positions

### Bug Fixes and Reliability

#### Resolved Issues
1. **Double Position Insertion**: Fixed `validateMove()` method that was adding test positions to history without proper cleanup
2. **Missing Starting Position**: Ensured starting position is always included at index 0
3. **Chess.js Reliability**: Replaced unreliable Chess.js `isThreefoldRepetition()` with manual tracking

#### Position History Integrity
- **Test Move Cleanup**: `validateMove()` properly removes test positions from history
- **Error Recovery**: Exception handling ensures position history consistency
- **Synchronization**: Position history stays synchronized with actual game moves

### Integration with Game Systems

#### UI Components
- **MoveHistoryPanel**: Displays draw results with proper formatting
- **GameControls**: Handles draw detection and game ending
- **Status Display**: Shows three-fold repetition as draw reason

#### AI Integration
- **Move Processing**: Three-fold repetition detection works with AI moves
- **Game Ending**: AI respects three-fold repetition draws
- **Status Updates**: AI state management handles draw conditions

### Testing and Validation

#### Test Scenarios
- **Exact Repetition**: Starting position repeated 3 times triggers draw
- **Knight Maneuvers**: Nf3-Ng1-Nf3-Ng1 pattern creates repetition
- **Position Counting**: Verified correct counting of position occurrences
- **History Tracking**: Confirmed proper position history management

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Usage**: Linear growth with game length (one FEN string per move)
- **Computation**: O(n) position comparison for each move
- **Accuracy**: 100% accurate three-fold repetition detection
- **Integration**: Zero impact on existing game flow

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run development server with three-fold repetition
npm run dev

# Test three-fold repetition scenarios
npm test

# Build with manual implementation
npm run build
```

## Game Analysis Interface

### Overview
The chess program features a comprehensive game analysis interface that provides real-time position evaluation using Stockfish.js v10.0.2. The analysis system offers post-game review capabilities with interactive navigation and visual feedback.

### Key Features

#### Real-Time Evaluation
- **Engine**: Stockfish.js v10.0.2 WebAssembly chess engine
- **Analysis Depth**: Configurable depth (default: 20 plies)
- **Progressive Updates**: Real-time evaluation updates from depth 1 to target depth
- **Evaluation Types**: Centipawn scores and mate-in-X positions
- **Perspective**: All evaluations shown from current player's perspective

#### Visual Evaluation Bar
- **Design**: Vertical evaluation bar with white/black sections
- **Scale**: Logarithmic scale for better visual representation (±500 centipawns)
- **Game States**: Special handling for checkmate/stalemate positions
- **Result Display**: Shows game results (1-0, 0-1, ½-½) in appropriate sections
- **Midline**: Red line indicating equal position (0.00)

#### Interactive Navigation
- **Move History**: Click any move to jump to that position
- **Keyboard Controls**: Arrow keys (↑↓←→) for move navigation
- **Starting Position**: Auto-analysis of opening position
- **Progressive FEN**: Accurate position calculation for each move

#### Game Result Integration
- **Resignation Support**: Displays resignation results using exact format from main game
- **Status Consistency**: Matches main interface styling and terminology
- **Result Types**: Handles all game endings (checkmate, stalemate, resignation, draw)

### Technical Implementation

#### File Structure
```
src/components/
├── GameAnalysis.tsx          # Main analysis component
├── GameAnalysis.css          # Analysis interface styling
├── GameContainer.tsx         # Integration with main game
└── GameControls.tsx          # Analyze button implementation

src/ai/
└── StockfishEngine.ts        # Enhanced with evaluation callbacks
```

#### Dependencies
- **Chess.js**: Position management and PGN parsing
- **Stockfish.js**: Chess engine via Web Workers
- **React**: Component state management and UI
- **Canvas**: Board rendering through CanvasChessBoard component

#### Key Constants
```typescript
const ANALYSIS_DEPTH = 20; // Configurable analysis depth
```

#### State Management
- `evaluation`: Current position evaluation (centipawns or mate score)
- `currentDepth`: Current analysis depth (1-20)
- `mateInMoves`: Mate distance when applicable
- `engineReady`: Engine initialization status
- `moveFens`: Pre-calculated FEN strings for all positions

### Integration Points

#### Orchestrator Integration
- Launched via "Analyze" button (replaces "Resign" when game ends)
- Receives game PGN and result from `GameContainer`
- Uses `gameState.result` for consistent result display

#### Engine Communication
- Extended `StockfishEngine.ts` with evaluation callback system
- Real-time updates via `setEvaluationCallback()`
- Progressive depth analysis with `evaluatePosition(depth)`
- Proper turn-based score interpretation for both centipawn and mate scores

#### UI Components
- Modal overlay with three-panel layout (evaluation, board, moves)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Consistent styling with main interface color scheme

### Score Calculation Logic

#### Centipawn Scores
```typescript
// Current player perspective (same as mate scores)
if (currentTurn === 'w') {
  adjustedScore = info.score.cp;      // White's turn: use as-is
} else {
  adjustedScore = -info.score.cp;     // Black's turn: flip sign
}
```

#### Mate Scores
```typescript
// Mate scores relative to current player
if (currentTurn === 'w') {
  mateScore = info.score.mate > 0 ? 999999 : -999999;  // White advantage/disadvantage
} else {
  mateScore = info.score.mate > 0 ? -999999 : 999999;  // Black advantage becomes white disadvantage
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **←/↑**: Previous move
- **→/↓**: Next move
- **Escape**: Close analysis (handled by modal)

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-calculated FEN positions to avoid redundant computation
- Evaluation caching at component level
- Progressive loading with depth-based updates
- Web Worker isolation for engine calculations

### Error Handling
- Engine initialization failure gracefully handled
- Invalid FEN string validation
- Move parsing error recovery
- Timeout prevention for deep analysis (no timeout limit)

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple line analysis (Multi-PV support)
- Opening book integration
- Position annotation system
- Analysis export functionality

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Known Limitations
- Analysis depth fixed at component level (requires recompilation to change)
- Single line analysis only (no Multi-PV yet)
- No persistent analysis storage
- Engine warm-up time on first position
